Emotion classification project using NLP and machine learning. Text data is processed with TF-IDF and classified using Naive Bayes and SVM.
Emotion Classification using Machine Learning

 Project overview:
 
This project focuses on classifying emotions from text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze user-written comments and predict the associated emotion such as fear, joy, anger, or sadness.


Dataset:

-The dataset contains two main columns:

-Comment – Text data expressing emotions

-Emotion – Corresponding emotion label

-The dataset is preprocessed to remove noise and improve model performance.


Methodology:

-Text Preprocessing

-Lowercasing

-Removing punctuation and special characters

-Tokenization

-Stopword removal

-Lemmatization

-Feature Extraction

-TF-IDF Vectorizer is used to convert text into numerical features.


Model Development:

-Naive Bayes

-Support Vector Machine (SVM)


Model Evaluation:

-Accuracy and F1-score are used to compare model performance.

-Emotion Prediction

-The trained model predicts emotions for new, unseen text inputs.
